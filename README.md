## my git recipe

From the bash shell:

* `git pull`: update my local copy from github 
* `git add .`: include all files in my pending commit
* `git commit -m 'a comment'`: commit
* `git push`: send my updates to github

things can get snarled. when this happens: read up on git stash. 

## interesting urls
